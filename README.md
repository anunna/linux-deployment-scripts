# linux-deployment-scripts

These are various Linux deployment scripts that can be used to configure a server at deployment time. UDF variables are includes for ease of copy/paste into a Linode StackScript, or you can run the scripts standalone and they will prompt for needed values.

Use at your own risk. PRs welcome.
